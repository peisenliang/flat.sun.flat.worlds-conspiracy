        <h2>“Believe the Truth we Bestow.”</h2>

        <article>
            <h3>Article #1: The Truth</h3>
            <p>"Believe the Truth we Bestow." The official heliocentric model claims the Sun is a near-perfect plasma sphere, 1.39 million km in diameter, 149.6 million km away, powered by nuclear fusion. But repeatable measurements, geometry, and atmospheric observations suggest a different reality: a close, flat, disk-shaped Sun above a planar Earth.</p>

            <h4>Light Falloff & the Inverse-Square Discrepancy</h4>
            <p>Officially, light intensity I decreases with the square of distance: I ∝ 1/r². From equator to 66° latitude, irradiance should drop roughly by I × cos(θ) plus atmospheric loss.</p>
            <p>Observed:<br>
            Equator average = 1361 W/m²<br>
            66° latitude summer peak ≈ 550 W/m²</p>
            <p>Predicted (official) ≈ 230–300 W/m²</p>
            <p>This slower drop-off fits better with a closer, flat Sun where ray divergence is smaller.</p>

            <h4>Angular Diameter Constancy</h4>
            <p>With a spherical Sun, distance varies by about 5 million km yearly, so angular diameter should change by Δθ ≈ (Δd / d) × 100% = (5×10⁶ / 1.496×10⁸) × 100% ≈ 3.34%</p>
            <p>Expected angular diameter in arcminutes varies from ~32.53′ to ~33.62′. Observed solar photography shows negligible variance within ±0.05′ — consistent with a fixed-distance flat Sun.</p>

            <h4>High-Altitude Light Divergence</h4>
            <p>If the Sun were 149.6 million km away, sunlight rays should be essentially parallel (<0.01° divergence). At 20 km altitude, sunrise/sunset timelapse shows rays diverging by about 6–12°, implying a light source only a few thousand km above Earth.</p>

            <h4>Limb Darkening = Edge Foreshortening</h4>
            <p>Spherical model explains limb darkening as cooler upper layers of a gaseous sphere. Disk model replicates this effect with laboratory halogen disks due to edge-angle emission alone.</p>

            <h4>Other Observations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Thermal Distribution Deviations: Localized hotspots resemble a nearby overhead Sun.</li>
                <li>Shadow Length Inconsistencies: Recalculations using a flat Sun give consistent results.</li>
                <li>Polar Midnight Sun Angle Mismatch: Vertical oscillations of about 2° fit a nearby Sun.</li>
                <li>Solar Transit Timing Anomalies: Sunrise takes 4–5 minutes at high latitudes, implying a closer Sun.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Final Assertion:</strong> All measurable effects match a close, flat, disk-shaped Sun better than a distant sphere. The numbers are factual; only the interpretation has been obscured.</p>

            <h3>Article #2: Quoting Professionals</h3>
            <blockquote>“Believe the Truth we Bestow”</blockquote>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, Peer Review Evader: “Peer review is redundant when the evidence is this clear.”</p>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, Satellite Image Debunker: “Don’t tell them that! Just say Satellite images are fabricated; my measurements are firsthand.”</p>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, Keeper of Angular Truths: “The angular diameter of the sun is constant, as I have meticulously documented.”</p>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, Rooftop Solar Photographer Extraordinaire: “Observations from my rooftop prove what textbooks deny.”</p>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, Latitude Light Intensity Guru: “Every latitude’s solar intensity fits my model better than theirs.”</p>
            <p>Pei Sen Liang, the Homeless Guy: “I wonder how long people read this to realize it was satire.”</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Forget the distant, bloated ball of fire—they claim the Sun is flat and nearby. This is satire. If you need proof of reality, check out NASA and ESA links provided in the article.</p>
